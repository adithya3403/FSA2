/* Percentages */

a%b=a/b*100
in questions of percentage more or percentage increase, diff*100/smaller_no.
in questions of percentage less or percentage decrease, diff*100/larger_no.
if x is increased by n% it becomes x(100+n)/100
if x is decreased by n% it becomes x(100-n)/100
if L changes by x% and B changes by y%, area changes by (x+y+(xy/100))%
if side of square S changes by x%, area changes by (2x+(x^2/100))/%

1. price of a computer increases by 20% from jan to feb. It further increases by 15% from Feb to march
    If the price is x in jan, what is the price in march ?
ans: x -> x(120)/100=1.2x
    let y=1.2x
    y -> 115y/100=1.15y=1.15(1.2x)=1.38x

2. length of a rectangle increases by 40% while breadth decreases by 25%, what happens to the area?
a) no change b) increase of 5% c) decrease of 5% d) increase of 10%
ans: 40-25-10=+5=increase by 5%

3. side of a square decreases by 30%, its area will change by what %?
ans: -60+9=-51% = decreases by 51%

*** 4. in a toy store, 50% of the toys are large 50% are small. 40% are red, 60% are green
    10% of the toys are red and small, 40 toys are green and large, how many toys are red and large ?
    a) 30 b) 60 c) 120 d) none
ans:    R    G
    S  10%  40%
    L  30%  20%
total  40%  60% => 30%*2=60  toys

/* profit and loss */

P=SP-CP
L=CP-SP
SP=CP(100+P)/100
SP=CP(100-L)/100
SP=MP(100-d)/100
SP=MP(100-a)/100 (100-b)/100

1. two discounts of a% and b% is equal to single discount of (a+b)%
ans: false, two discounts of a% and b% is equal to single discount of (a+b-(ab/100))

when two items are sold at the same price and at the same profit or loss % (say k%), then
    there is always a loss if k^2/100%

/* time and distance */

speed or velocity = distance/time
avg speed=total d/total t
*** if the same distance is covered with different speeds u and v, avg speed will be harmonic mean of the speed=2uv/u+v
if u are late by x mins with a speed v1 and early by y mins with a speed v2, d=(v2v1)(x+y)/60(v2-v1)

u and v travel in opp direction from a distance D, tc=D/(u+v)
smae direction, to=D/(u-v)
if 2 trains of length x and y, D=x+y
